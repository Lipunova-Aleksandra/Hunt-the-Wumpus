Welcome to Hunt the Wumpus!
The wumpus lives in a cave of 20 rooms. Each room has three tunnels
leading to other rooms. Look at a dodecahedron to see how this works.
If you don't know what a dodecahedron is, ask someone or get thee to
a Wikipedia.

HAZARDS
 Bottomless pits - Two rooms have bottomless pits in them. If you go
  there, you fall into the pit (and lose!)
 Super bats - Two other rooms have super bats. If you go there, a bat
  grabs you and take you to some other room at random, which might be
  troublesome.
 The Wumpus - The Wumpus is not bothered by the hazards (he has sucker
  feet and is too big for a bat to lift). Usually he is asleep. Two
  things wake him up you entering his room or you shooting an arrow.
  If the wumpus wakes, he moves one room. If he is where you are, he 
  eats you up (and you lose!)

YOU
Each turn you may move or shoot a crooked arrow.
 Moving You can go one room (through one tunnel).
 Shooting Each arrow can go 1 to 5 rooms. You aim by telling the 
  computer the rooms you want the arrow to go to. If the arrow hits the 
  Wumpus, you win. If the arrow misses the Wumpus, it moves.

WARNINGS
When you are one room away from a hazard, the computer says
 Wumpus 'I smell a Wumpus!'
 Bat 'I hear flapping!'
 Pit 'I feel a draft!'
